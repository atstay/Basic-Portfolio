        <p>My name is Anthony Tran-Son-Tay. I hail from north Florida near Atlanta, Georgia. I moved here three years ago in order to be able to climb outdoors. I love the outdoors and getting my adrenaline fix; however, I'm always constantly eager to learn new things and am very excited to learn to program!</p>
        <p>I'm super stoked to learn to code. I never really did coding aside from editing webpages back in middle school. Unfortunately I lost most that I learned back then, but hopefully it will all come back shortly! So far bootcamp is great! Definitely tough but I'm always up for a challenge. Ideally I would like to eventually work for a cyber security company; however, that of course depends on how well I can pick up basic web development first!</p>
